Constant Current Charge then Wait
=================================

The goal of this test is to charge the capacitor at a constant current
to a set voltage, then turn off the source meter and observe the open
circuit voltage drop. This allows us to observe both absorption while
charging at different currents (by looking at the differential of the voltage
siganl), and also allows us to measure absorption after charging 
as it falls away to the capacitors static leakage. This test
should be run at a range of constant currents, and a range of max voltages.
