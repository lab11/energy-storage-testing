Tests
=====

This directory contains all of our own testing and results of energy storage.
This includes all methodologies and scripts to replicate the experiments. Current 
all scripts are written for a keithley 2612b source meter. Tests are 
roughly organized by storage type, then individual test type. Each test
should have a readme describing exactly what it is attempting to measure
and its methodology for doing so.
